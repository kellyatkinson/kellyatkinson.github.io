      Olympic recurve archer based in Auckland, New Zealand, competing in World Archery target and field events and in IFAA field disciplines.

      Nine years ago I picked up a bow and have since worked through regional, national, and now international championships—most recently taking the World Champion title at the 2024 IFAA World Field Archery Championships and shooting New Zealand record scores at both IFAA and World Archery field events.

      I split my time between outdoor 70 m target seasons, indoor seasons, and field training in and near Auckland with a focus on consistency, technical refinement, and competition readiness.
